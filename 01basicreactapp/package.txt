some notes-:
* function name in any component should be start with capital latter.
* all components int he react app should be wrapped in the single component 
* while making any component keep file name with jsx file.
* basicaly react created a virtual dom for rendering all the app component in single page , it uses package react-dom and its methods  
and we are manipulating this dom using jsx.
